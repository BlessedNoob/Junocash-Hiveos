Needs libhwloc15
shell in and run

sudo apt update
sudo apt install libhwloc15

Custom link should install normal, make sure hiveos flightsheet is correct

Wallet and Worker Template should look like this
  youraddress.%WORKER_NAME% enter the wallet address manually
  
Unfortuantely for now there is no hashrate reporting, that's just how this xmrig was compiled. If it gets updated I will try my best to get it working
Also please ignore $CUSTOM_LOG_BASENAME, no effects to the miner at all, this is my first wrapper
